What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
The attributes and the constructor for computer and resale shop worked. However, the methods were not working for resaleshop. There were slight spelling errors for the attributes and constructed for computer. My advice is to read the comments and instruction carefully. Also, work with others to help each other.
